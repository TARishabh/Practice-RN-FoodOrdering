First create a new expo project using:

npx create-expo-app@latest FoodOrdering -t
and then select Navigation (TypeScript)

Now move app, constants, and components folder in a single folder called src

and update all the imports in all the files,

index.tsx
_layout.tsx
+not-found.tsx
two.tsx
Themed.tsx
useColorScheme.web.tsx
EditScreenInfo.tsx
model.tsx
